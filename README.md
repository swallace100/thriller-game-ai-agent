# 🎭 Thriller Game AI Agent

A narrative-driven thriller game powered by AI agents, where players interact with a dynamic **Narrator Agent** that weaves suspenseful storylines — and secretly consults a **Research Agent** for accurate real-world facts when needed.

> 🧠 The player never interacts with the research agent directly. The narrator handles all in-world responses, maintaining immersion and tone while integrating researched knowledge only when necessary.

## 🕹️ Features

- **Narrator Agent**:

  - Responds to player input with rich story progression
  - Controls pacing, tone, and dramatic tension
  - Detects when real-world information is needed and triggers research behind the scenes

- **Research Agent**:

  - Activated only by the narrator
  - Uses AI or web tools to search factual information (e.g., history, symbols, psychology, places)
  - Feeds back concise data to the narrator to integrate into the story

## 📌 Example Flow

**User Input**:

> What is the symbol on the floor? It looks like a spiral with a triangle.

**Narrator Output**:

> `[[RESEARCH: spiral with triangle symbol occult meaning]]`

**Research Agent Response**:

> This symbol resembles the Triquetra, a pagan emblem representing the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

**Final Narrator Response**:

> The symbol isn’t random — it's an ancient triquetra. Your skin tingles as you realize this place may be tied to something far older... and darker.
